    "Whether you should take the average scores of each individual athlete or put in multiple entries for each athlete depends on the specific requirements and constraints of your problem. Let me provide some guidance for both scenarios:\n",
    "\n",
    "Taking Average Scores:\n",
    "- If you take the average scores of each individual athlete on each apparatus, you are essentially representing the athlete's overall performance on that apparatus with a single value.\n",
    "- This approach simplifies the optimization problem because you're working with a smaller set of variables (one score per athlete per apparatus), making it easier to manage and solve.\n",
    "- Taking averages can be appropriate if you want to find the best team that performs well on average across all apparatuses.\n",
    "\n",
    "Multiple Entries for Each Athlete:\n",
    "- If you allow multiple entries for each athlete, you are considering the athlete's performance on each apparatus as an independent entry.\n",
    "- This approach can be beneficial if you want to fine-tune the team selection to maximize the overall team score on each apparatus. Each athlete's contribution on each apparatus is treated separately.\n",
    "- Allowing multiple entries can lead to a larger optimization problem with more decision variables."
