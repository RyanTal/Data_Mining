    "\n",
    "1. `import pulp`: This line imports the PuLP library, which is used for modeling and solving linear programming problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. `import itertools`: This line imports the itertools library, which provides various functions for working with iterators and iterable data.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. `prob = pulp.LpProblem(\"Athlete_Selection\", pulp.LpMaximize)`: This line creates a Linear Programming problem named \"Athlete_Selection\" to be solved with the goal of maximizing an objective function. The `prob` object is an instance of the `LpProblem` class.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. `athletes = df['Name'].unique()`: This line retrieves a list of unique athlete names from a DataFrame (presumably named `df`) and assigns it to the `athletes` variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. `athlete_vars = pulp.LpVariable.dicts(\"Select\", athletes, 0, 1, pulp.LpInteger)`: This line defines a set of binary decision variables using the athlete names as keys. These variables represent whether an athlete is selected (1) or not selected (0) for the competition. The variables are created with a lower bound of 0 and an upper bound of 1, and they are of integer type.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. `objective = pulp.lpSum(athlete_vars[athlete] for athlete in athletes)`: This line creates the objective function. The objective is to maximize the sum of the decision variables, which corresponds to maximizing the number of selected athletes.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. `prob += objective`: This line adds the objective function to the Linear Programming problem (`prob`) that was defined earlier.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. `prob += pulp.lpSum(athlete_vars[athlete] for athlete in athletes) == 5`: This line adds a constraint to the problem. It specifies that exactly 5 athletes must be selected, and this constraint is added to the `prob` problem.\n",

    "\n",
    "11. `athletes_for_event = [athlete_vars[athlete] for athlete in athletes if any(df[(df['Name'] == athlete) & (df['apparatus'] == event)]['Average Total'].notna())]`: For each apparatus, this line creates a list of decision variables representing athletes who can compete in the current apparatus. It checks if an athlete has a non-null value in the 'Average Total' column for that apparatus in the DataFrame.\n",
    "\n",
    "12. `prob += pulp.lpSum(athletes_for_event) == 3`: This line adds a constraint to the problem, ensuring that exactly 3 athletes are selected for the current apparatus. It adds this constraint to the `prob` problem.\n",

    "14. `selected_athletes = [athlete for athlete in athletes if pulp.value(athlete_vars[athlete]) == 1]`: This line creates a list of athlete names who have been selected for the competition.

    "Certainly! At a high level, this code is solving an athlete selection problem for a sports competition using linear programming. The objective is to select a set of athletes who will compete while satisfying certain constraints. Here's the big picture idea of what the code is doing:\n",

    "1. **Problem Setup**:\n",
    "   - It imports the necessary libraries, PuLP and itertools.\n",
    "   - Creates a Linear Programming problem with the goal of maximizing an objective function. The problem is named \"Athlete_Selection.\"\n",

    "3. **Objective Function**:\n",
    "   - Defines an objective function that aims to maximize the number of selected athletes. In other words, it maximizes the sum of the binary decision variables.\n",

    "4. **Constraints**:\n",
    "   - Ensures that exactly 5 athletes are selected by adding a constraint that limits the sum of the decision variables to equal 5.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - For each apparatus (event), it ensures that exactly 3 athletes are selected to compete. It identifies which athletes can participate in each apparatus based on certain conditions in the data and adds constraints for each apparatus.\n",

    "5. **Solving the Problem**:\n",
    "   - Solves the linear programming problem using the CBC solver, aiming to find the optimal combination of athletes that maximizes the number of selected athletes while satisfying all constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Extracting and Printing the Results**:\n",
    "   - After solving the problem, it identifies the athletes that were selected (decision variables with a value of 1) and prints their names along with the apparatus they will compete in.\n",

    "In summary, this code uses linear programming to automate the selection of athletes for a sports competition. It maximizes the number of athletes while ensuring that there are exactly 5 athletes selected overall and 3 athletes selected for each apparatus.
