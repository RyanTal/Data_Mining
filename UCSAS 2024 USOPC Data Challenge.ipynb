    "\n",
    "Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "For this data challenge, your goal is to identify the group of 5 athletes who will enable the Team USA Olympic Men’s and Women’s Artistic Gymnastics teams to optimize success in Paris 2024. You are tasked with developing an analytics model that can be used to identify and compare the expected medal count in the 8 medal events for men (team all-around, individual all-around, floor exercise, pommel horse, still rings, vault, parallel bars, and high bar) and 6 medal events for the women (team all-around, individual all-around, vault, uneven bars, balance beam, and floor exercise).\n",
    "\n",
    "In total, 192 artistic gymnasts will compete at Paris 2024: 96 men and 96 women. Team events will feature 12 teams of 5 athletes each in the men’s and women’s events.* For countries that do not win a full team entry for Paris 2024, a maximum of 3 individuals per country will be able to qualify. Those remaining 36 entries for each gender will be determined by results of the 2023 World Championships, the 2024 World Cup Series, and the 2024 Continental Championships.\n",
    "\n",
    "For each gender, 3 teams qualified at the 2022 World Championships in Liverpool, England. In the men’s competition, teams from China, Japan, and Great Britain qualified. In the women’s competition, teams from the United States, Great Britain, and Canada qualified. For each gender, 9 other countries will qualify teams based on their placements at the 2023 World Championships in Antwerp, Belgium, which will take place from September 30, 2023, and October 8, 2023.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Note that at Tokyo 2020, men’s and women’s teams were composed of 4 athletes. Countries with full teams could also qualify up to 2 additional athletes to compete in Tokyo as individuals. The Team USA men had a 4-person team of Brody Malone, Sam Mikulak, Yul Moldauer, and Shane Wiskus. The USA men had one individual athlete, Alec Yoder, who could compete in the qualifying round at the Olympics to potentially qualify for the individual all-around and the apparatus finals. Similarly, the Team USA women had a 4-person team of Simone Biles, Jordan Chiles, Sunisa Lee, and Grace McCallum. The USA women had two individual athletes, Jade Carey and MyKayla Skinner, who could compete in the qualifying round at the Olympics to potentially qualify for the individual all-around and the apparatus finals.\n",
    "\n",
    "According to recent news, gymnasts from Russia and Belarus will be allowed to take part in sanctioned competitions as “individual neutral athletes” from the start of 2024. Based on that information, Russia and Belarus will not be able to qualify for team artistics gymnastics events in Paris, but they would each be able to qualify up to 3 athletes to compete as individuals, as described above.\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem of choosing a team is complicated by the structure of the Olympic competition. For both the men and women, the athletes first compete in a qualifying round in which their scores are used to determine advancement of teams (i.e,, countries) to the team all-around final and individuals to the individual all-around final and apparatus finals. In qualifying, 4 of the 5 athletes on each team compete on each apparatus, so not every athlete will compete in all apparatus. The athletes representing countries who did not qualify a full team may participate on all apparatus in the qualifying round.\n",
    "\n",
    "The top 8 teams in qualifying advance to the team final based on the sum of the top 3 out of 4 scores on each apparatus (“4 up, 3 count”, for a total of 18 scores for men and 12 scores for women). Athletes must compete on all apparatus in qualifying to be eligible for the individual all-around final. The top 24 athletes qualify for the individual all-around final, with a maximum of two gymnasts per country. The top 8 athletes on each apparatus qualify for the final in that apparatus, again with a maximum of 2 gymnasts per country.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the team all-around, individual all-around, and individual apparatus finals, all athletes’ scores from qualifying are thrown out. In the team all-around final, the medalists are determined by the sum of the 3 scores on each apparatus (“3 up, 3 count”, for a total of 18 scores for men and 12 scores for women). An athlete’s scores in the team all-around final have no effect on their scores in the individual all-around final, and in the individual apparatus finals, all previous scores from qualifying, the team all-around final, and the individual all-around final are thrown out.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this data challenge is to put together the best possible men’s and women’s Team USA Olympic Artistic Gymnastics teams, however, the meaning of “best” is left open to the interpretation of the entrant.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, a few questions that students could consider for their entry include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- How would your recommended team differ if you are trying to maximize total medal count, gold medals, or a weighted medal count (e.g., 3 for gold, 2 for silver, 1 for bronze)? How would your recommended team change if you consider a team all-around medal to be more valuable than the individual all-around medals and/or if you consider the individual all-around medals to be more valuable than the individual apparatus medals? Can Team USA maximize its total medal count by selecting a team of 5 gymnasts who are all-around gymnasts, event specialists (gymnasts who focus on 1 or more apparatus but not all apparatus), or a combination of those? Under what circumstances can Team USA maximize its total medal count by selecting a gymnast who only competes on 1 apparatus (e.g., Stephen Nederoscik, 2021 pommel horse World Champion)?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Data from major domestic and international gymnastics competitions from the seasons leading up to the 2020 Tokyo and 2024 Paris Olympics will be provided to entrants. Because the Code of Points scoring system is changed each Olympic cycle, data from the years (2017-2021) leading up to the 2020 Olympics, which actually took place in 2021, should be used as a separate data set from the data from competitions in the 2022 and 2023 seasons leading up to the 2024 Olympics.\n",
    "\n",
    "The cleaned data is on GitHub, which is being actively updated. The last update of data will be the 2023 World Artistic Gymnastics Championships in Belgium, which ends in early October, 2023.\n",
    "\n",
    "Entrants can use any additional data that they choose as long as that data is publicly available, but the additional data need to be included in the final submission for reproducibility\n",
    "\n",
    "## Submission\n",
    "\n",
    "Students must submit a zip file containing:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A pdf report describing their results (max 3000 words)\n",
    "- A folder with\n",
    "    - Documented code files\n",
    "    - A README file describing what each file does.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: Students can include other files including any app code or supporting documents. Any code or apps included need to be self-contained and able to run on reviewers’ computers without modification.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Eligibility\n",
    "\n",

    "## Qualifiers for Paris 2024\n",
    "\n",
    "The countries and individual gymnasts who have qualified for Paris 2024 are listed here: Men's Qualifiers, Women's Qualifiers. Quota spots can be qualified by country (NOC – National Olympic Committee) or by athlete name, as explained below:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Criteria 1 and 2:** After the World Championships in early October 2023, all full teams of 5 gymnasts in Men’s (12) and Women’s (12) Artistic Gymnastics qualifying to the Paris 2024 Olympics were determined. The gymnasts who will compete for each qualified country will be selected by their countries’ gymnastics federations. Each country’s gymnastics federation has their own process for selecting their athletes.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Criteria 3:** At the World Championships in early October 2023, for the Men’s and Women’s events, 3 countries who did not qualify full teams for Paris 2024 earned one quota place each. Each of those countries’ gymnastics federations will select the athletes for those quota places.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Criteria 4 & 5:** At the World Championships in early October 2023, for the Men’s and Women’s events, several athletes who did not qualify full teams for Paris 2024 earned a quota place for themselves by name for Paris 2024.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Criteria 6:** 12 Men and 8 Women from countries who did not qualify full teams for Paris 2024 and who did not earn a quota place for themselves through Criteria 4 or 5 will earn quota places for themselves by name through the 2024 Apparatus World Cup Series, which concludes in April 2024.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Criteria 7:** The highest ranked Men’s and Women’s athlete in the All-Around Qualifications results or the All-Around Final results at each Continental Championships from a country who did not qualify a full team for Paris 2024 and did not earn a place for themselves by name through Criteria 4, 5, or 6 will earn a quote place for themselves by name.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the Pan Am Games in October 2023, Audrys Nin Reyes (DOM) earned the Men’s quote place and Luisa Blanco (COL) earned the Women’s place for the Americas. These names are not yet indicated under Criteria 7, #1 PAGU on the attached lists. The other Continental Championships will take place in April and May 2024.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Host Country Place:** If France does not qualify a Man to Paris 2024 through Criteria 6 or 7, the Host Country quota place will be allocated by name to Leo SALADINO, the highest ranked Men’s French athlete based on the All-Around Qualifications results of the 2023 World Championships. Because France qualified a full Women’s team to Paris 2024, the Host Country Place for Women has already been assigned to Rifda IRFANALUTHFI (INA).\n",
    "\n",
    "**NOTE:** Any country that did not qualify a full Men’s team for Paris 2024 can qualify a maximum of 3 individual athletes each. The same rule applies to the Women. For example, the German(GER) Women have already qualified the maximum of 3 quota places—a quote place by country (Criteria 3), Pauline Schaefer-Betz (Criteria 4), and Sarah Voss (Criteria 5).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Q&A Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Question:** What does the \"all around\" mean?\n",
    "   - **Answer:** In the team all around qualification, 4 of the 5 members of a team compete on each apparatus and the top 3 scores on each apparatus count. In the team all around final, 3 of the 5 members compete on each apparatus and all 3 scores on each apparatus count. In the individual all around, each of the 24 qualified athletes performs on each apparatus once.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Question:** Is the qualification to qualify for the Olympics or to qualify for the finals of the Olympics?\n",
    "   - **Answer:** The qualification is to qualify for the team all around final, individual all around, and event finals within the Olympic competition itself, not to qualify for the Olympics.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Question:** Should we develop a model to predict medal counts for combinations, or pick 5 specific athletes?\n",
    "   - **Answer:** Develop a model for combinations first, but also provide a rank order of combinations and the best team of 5.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Question:** Can the final submission content just be the model, or also the 5 athletes the model selects?\n",
    "   - **Answer:** Include all components - report, code, data. Highlight the optimal teams of 5 in the report.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "11. **Question:** For missing scores, is it appropriate to replace with zeros?\n",
    "    - **Answer:** Missing scores likely mean the gymnast didn’t compete. If the gymnast didn’t compete, delete those records rather than averaging in zeros. However, there are rare cases in which the gymnast competed and earned a score of zero, such as with Donnell Whittenburg on his Vault during the team all around qualification at the 2022 World Championships.\n",
    "\n",
    "12. **Question:** How are collegiate and elite scoring related?\n",
    "    - **Answer:** Very little relationship. Men's college uses elite scoring, but women's college is very different.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "15. **Question:** Should results include alternates?\n",
    "    - **Answer:** An element of originality if you can do it and it provides additional insight to your analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "18. **Question:** How is the originality of the analysis judged?\n",
    "    - **Answer:** What you have done that is different from the norm and demonstrates additional insight.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 19. **Question:** How do we communicate our results?\n",
    "##    - **Answer:** Visualizations in code can be included, select key graphs for the written report.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "21. **Question:** Do the extra 36 gymnasts qualify for specific apparatus and/or the all-around, and then only compete in those events for which they qualified?\n",
    "    - **Answer:** The extra 36 Men and the extra 36 Women, who will qualify for Paris through a variety of competitions and both all-around and individual apparatus events, may participate on all apparatus in the Qualifications in Paris. All 96 Men (60 on full teams + 36 extra) in Paris will compete in Qualifications in Paris on the first day of competition for Men’s Artistic Gymnastics (July 27, 2024). Likewise, all 96 Women (60 on full teams + 36 extra) in Paris will compete in Qualifications on the first day of competition for Women’s Artistic Gymnastics (July 28, 2024).\n",
