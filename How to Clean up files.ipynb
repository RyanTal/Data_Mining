    "Cleaning up a large GitHub repository by removing unused CSV files or Jupyter Notebook files (ipynb) can be automated using a combination of Git commands and scripting. Here are general steps you can follow:\n",
    "1. Identify Unused Files:\n",
    "\n",
    "To identify files that are not being used, you can use tools like git ls-files and git log. For instance, to find all CSV files not present in the latest commit, you can run:\n",
    "\n",
    "bash\n",
    "\n",
    "git log --name-only --pretty=format: | grep -e '.*\\.csv$' | sort -u\n",
    "\n",
    "For Jupyter Notebooks:\n",
    "\n",
    "bash\n",
    "\n",
    "git log --name-only --pretty=format: | grep -e '.*\\.ipynb$' | sort -u\n",
    "\n",
    "This will list all CSV or ipynb files that have been committed at some point but are not in the latest commit.\n",
    "2. Dry Run Before Deletion:\n",
    "\n",
    "Before actually deleting files, perform a dry run to see what will be deleted. You can use the xargs command along with git rm --cached for this:\n",
    "\n",
    "bash\n",
    "\n",
    "git log --name-only --pretty=format: | grep -e '.*\\.csv$' | sort -u | xargs git rm --cached\n",
    "\n",
    "Replace '.*\\.csv$' with the pattern for ipynb files if you are cleaning those.\n",
    "3. Commit the Changes:\n",
    "\n",
    "After the dry run, commit the changes to your local repository:\n",
    "\n",
    "bash\n",
    "\n",
    "git commit -m \"Remove unused CSV and ipynb files\"\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Push Changes to GitHub:\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, push the changes to GitHub:\n",
    "\n",
    "bash\n",
    "\n",
    "git push origin master\n",
    "\n",
    "Important Notes:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Be very careful when performing mass deletion operations. Make sure you have a backup or are working in a controlled environment.\n",
    "    Ensure you don't delete files that might be needed later. Review the list of files before confirming the deletion.\n",
    "    Adapt the commands based on your specific requirements and the structure of your repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "Always consider testing these commands in a safe environment first and possibly on a branch before applying changes to the main branch. Also, if your repository is used collaboratively, communicate your intentions with other contributors to avoid conflicts."
