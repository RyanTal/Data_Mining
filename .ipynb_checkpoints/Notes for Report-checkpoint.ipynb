    "   - PuLP is a Python library for modeling linear programming problems. When someone refers to \"Linear Programming with PuLP,\" they are likely indicating that they are using the PuLP library to formulate and solve linear programming problems. It's not a distinct type of linear programming but rather an implementation or tool for working with linear programming in Python.\n",

    "   - Linear Programming is a method to achieve the best outcome (such as maximum profit or lowest cost) in a mathematical model whose requirements are represented by linear relationships. In an LP optimization problem, the goal is to optimize a linear objective function subject to linear equality and inequality constraints.\n",
