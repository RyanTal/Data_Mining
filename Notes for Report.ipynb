    "1. **Integer Linear Programming (ILP) model:**\n",
    "   - Integer Linear Programming extends Linear Programming by introducing the additional constraint that some or all decision variables must be integers (whole numbers). This is used when the decision variables must take on discrete values.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Linear Programming with PuLP:**\n",
    "   - PuLP is a Python library for modeling linear programming problems. When someone refers to \"Linear Programming with PuLP,\" they are likely indicating that they are using the PuLP library to formulate and solve linear programming problems. It's not a distinct type of linear programming but rather an implementation or tool for working with linear programming in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP):**\n",
    "   - Mixed-Integer Linear Programming is a generalization of ILP. In MILP, some of the decision variables are allowed to take on fractional values (like in linear programming), while others must take on integer values. This flexibility can be useful in modeling certain types of problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Linear Programming (LP) optimization problem:**\n",
    "   - Linear Programming is a method to achieve the best outcome (such as maximum profit or lowest cost) in a mathematical model whose requirements are represented by linear relationships. In an LP optimization problem, the goal is to optimize a linear objective function subject to linear equality and inequality constraints.\n",

    "In summary, Linear Programming is the general term for problems where both the objective function and the constraints are linear. Integer Linear Programming and Mixed-Integer Linear Programming introduce constraints related to integer values.\n",

    "- Simulated annealing (SA) is a related global optimization technique that traverses the search space by testing random mutations on an individual solution. A mutation that increases fitness is always accepted. A mutation that lowers fitness is accepted probabilistically based on the difference in fitness and a decreasing temperature parameter. In SA parlance, one speaks of seeking the lowest energy instead of the maximum fitness. SA can also be used within a standard GA algorithm by starting with a relatively high rate of mutation and decreasing it over time along a given schedule.\n",
    "- Tabu search (TS) is similar to simulated annealing in that both traverse the solution space by testing mutations of an individual solution. While simulated annealing generates only one mutated solution, tabu search generates many mutated solutions and moves to the solution with the lowest energy of those generated. In order to prevent cycling and encourage greater movement through the solution space, a tabu list is maintained of partial or complete solutions. It is forbidden to move to a solution that contains elements of the tabu list, which is updated as the solution traverses the solution space.\n",
